methods_long: "We incorporate mobility information into a simplified SIR model which\
  \ has an analytical solution with only two fitting parameters. Without any social-\
  \ distancing policy or geological/demographic inputs, the model works very well \
  \ for the twenty hardest-hit counties in the United States. This model is quite \
  \ different from other models yet provide parameters with clear physical meaning. \
  \ We have shown the cumulative mobility plays the role of time in controling \
  \ exponential growth of outbreak. Furthermore, there exists a critical relative \
  \ mobility above which outbreak will occur. For NYC, this critical relative \
  \ mobility is 30%. The critical relative mobility is ~60% for all other counties. \
  \ In this forecast, we chose the ~30 heaviest hit states, while combine the rest \
  \ of the states together into one superstate. This practice is necessary to obtain \
  \ meaningful model parameters. The forecast is based on Eq. 3 of the citation above, \
  \ fatality-reference, which is the average of the 11-day-period prior to prediction-date. \
  \ The cumulative mobility is the average of three Google mobility categories: \
  \ retail and recreation, transit station and work place. We have shown in \
  \ our paper those three categorites behave similarly. We conducted standard error \
  \ analysis on our forecast in which the uncertainty comes from both the fitting \
  \ error and the variation of the reference fatality. Quantile forecast is calculated \
  \ based on standard error assuming normal distribution. State-level forecast has been \
  \ included for 32 states. Other states and county-level forecast will be included later.\
  \ Starting Nov 29th, we included a summer reduction of 10% from 06/01 to 09/01 and an \
  \ election mobility increase of 25% from 09/01 to 11/03. The summer reduction of mobility \
  \ accounts for elevated outdoor activities while election mobility increase accounts for \
  \ large gatherings of political rally which maybe washed out in the averaged state-mobility. \
  \ We assume 80% of the vulnerable population will be vaccinated within three months. \
  \ The assumption is antibody will fully emerge after 2 weeks upon the 2nd shot. \
  \ To account for the recent mutations, we increases the infection rate by 20%. \
  \ Two vaccination scenarios have been considered and predicted which are shown in our website. \
  \ Google mobility data may have been affected by a recent Sep update. "
