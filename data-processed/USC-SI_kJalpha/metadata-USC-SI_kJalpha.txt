methods_long: We use our own epidemic model called SI-kJalpha, preliminary version
  of which we have successfully used during DARPA Grand Challenge 2014. Our model
  can consider the effect of many complexities of the epidemic process and yet be
  simplified to a few parameters that are learned using fast linear regressions. Therefore,
  our approach can learn and generate forecasts extremely quickly. On a 2 core desktop
  machine, our approach takes only 3.18s to tune hyper-parameters, learn parameters
  and generate 100 days of forecasts of reported cases and deaths for all the states
  in the US. The total execution time for 184 countries is 11.83s and for more than
  3000 US counties is 101.03s. Despite being fast, the accuracy of our forecasts is
  on par with the state-of-the-art as demonstrated on the leaderboard page. at https://scc-usc.github.io/ReCOVER-COVID-19.
  Our model is able to quickly adapt to changing trends, and the variations in parameters
  during different times/policies allow us to forecast different scenarios such as
  what would happen if we were to disregard social distancing suggestions.
  For each state, we model hospitalizations as a separate compartment, as a linear 
  function of recent cases with heterogeneous rates. This means that for some 
  hyper-parameter J, those who were infected at time t-1 to t-J will have a separate 
  rate from those infected at t-(J+1) to t-2J, and so on. This is similar to how we 
  perform death forecasts. For long-term forecasts (more than a few days in the future), 
  the cases are forecasted first based on our SIkJalpha model, which forms the input to 
  hospitalization prediction. 
  While we account for changing trends by putting more emphasis on recently seen data, 
  we assume that the trends will remain the same in the future for our point forecasts. 
  We try to account for changing trends in the future in our quantile forecasts by 
  modeling the empirical error our approach makes using a Random Forest.
