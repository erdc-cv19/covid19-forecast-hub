methods_long: "We make daily projections for infections and deaths\
  \ for 108 countries, 52 US states/territories, and 63 US counties.\
  \ For the US we calculate mortality rates by US region and time\
  \ based on the ages of people infected in a given region.\
  \ We provide the following data as a function of time and place:\
  \ cumulative and daily confirmed cases, cumulative and daily deaths,\
  \ confirmed case-based and death-based effective transmission ratios,\
  \ fraction of populations infected and constant infections transmission ratio,\
  \ probability of Covid-19 contact,\
  \ mortality and undercount, and fraction of positive tests.\
  \ Our projections are driven by the effective transmission ratio (Rt).\
  \ We analyze Rt change data through the course of the pandemic and apply\
  \ a model of that characteristic behavior to forecast infections and deaths."
