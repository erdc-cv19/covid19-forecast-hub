methods_long: A non-mechanistic, non-parametric model for prediction which forecasts
  time series as a sum of bell curves. Confidence intervals are provided by assuming
  a multiplicative log-Gaussian perturbation on the observed time series. While the 
  curve-fitting approach is based on a parsimonious function class, we also note that
  it arises as a simple outcome of an SIR-like process in a network setting, allowing
  the parameters of the fitted curve to contain structural meaning.
