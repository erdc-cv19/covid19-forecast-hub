methods_long: We use a novel model-agnostic Bayesian optimization ("BayesOpt") approach for learning the parameters of our SEIR model from observed data. All learning is end-to-end data driven with no spatio-temporal customisation. Percentiles are estimated using an uncertainty estimation algorithm built on BayesOpt trials. The point forecast is obtained via a weighted aggregation of BayesOpt trials.
